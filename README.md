# archlens-antipattern-detector
ArchLens is a tool that helps software architects and engineers identify architectural anti-patterns in distributed systems and microservices. By analyzing code, configuration, and service interaction data, it uses a combination of rule-based heuristics and AI/ML models to detect design flaws and offer remediation guidance.
